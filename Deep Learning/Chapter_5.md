# Machine Learning Basics

 “ A computer program is said to learn from experience **E*** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P** , if its performance at tasks in **T** , as measured by **P** , improves with experience **E**. ”

#### Task
- Classification
- Regression
- Transcription
- Machine Translation
- Structured Output
- Anomaly Detection
- Synthesis & Sampling
- Imputation of missing values
- Denoising
- Etc..

#### Performance
To evaluate abilities of machine learning algorithm, need to design a quantitative measure of the performance (evaluate on **test set**)

Ideally, we should choose a performance measure that corresponds well to the desired behaviour of the system

#### Experience
1. **Unsupervised learning** (Learn properties of the dataset; probability distribution)
2. **Supervised learning** (Learn to predict target from features; $P(y|x)$ )


### Linear Rregression
$$
\hat y =  w^Tx + b
$$
where $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of parameters (control behaviour of the system)

**Performace**

Mean Squared Error

$$
MSE_{test} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_i(\hat y - y)^2_i
$$


### Generalization Error
How well the model perform on unseen data (Measuring performance on test set)

How can we affect performance of testset when we get to observe only train set?

#### Statistical Learning Theory
Train and test set are generated by a probability distribution over dataset - **Data Generating Process**

Assumptions:
1. Examples in each datasets are **independent** from each other
2. Train and test set are identically distributed, drawn from same probability distribution

#### Factors determining how well ML algorithm perform

- Small training error
- Gap between training and test error small

#### Capacity
Model's ability to fit a wide variety of functions (control whether model will overfit/underfit)  

One way to control capacity : Choosing its **Hypothesis Space**; the set of functions that the learning algorithm is allowed to select as the solution
- Changing number of input features
- Simultaneously add new parameters associated to it

Arbitrary High Complexity: **Non-parametric** model (eg Nearest Neighbour)

**Bayes Error** - error incurred by oracle (knows the true probability distribution that generate the data) making prediction from the try distribution $p(x,y)$
