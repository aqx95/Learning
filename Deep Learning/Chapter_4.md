# Numerical Computation

Solving mathematical problems iteratively (update estimates) of the solution
e.g
1. Optimization
2. Solving systems of linear equations

#### Underflow
Numbers near zero are rounded to zero.

#### Overflow
Large numbers approximated as $\inf$

#### Poor Conditioning
Functions that change rapidly when their inputs are perturbed slightly

### Gradient-Based Optimization

**Objective Function** : function we want to minimize / maximize
